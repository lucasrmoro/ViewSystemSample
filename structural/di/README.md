# Runtime dependency injection

Owns the application's DI contracts. Feature and structural DI modules depend on
`di/api`; only `di/impl` depends on Koin. Replacing the runtime backend changes the
implementation and its Gradle dependency without rewriting consumer registrations.
Compile-time DI frameworks are outside this contract.

This foundational service has `api` and `impl`, without a self-registering `di`
module. It bootstraps other DI modules and does not depend on core, features, or
design-system. Both the runtime backend and AndroidX integration belong in `impl`.
Design-system and feature consumers depend only on `api`. The app is the composition
root and selects `impl`; no consumer accesses backend classes or Android factory
implementation functions.

## Startup and shutdown

`AppApplication` explicitly starts DI and loads structural modules before features:

```kotlin
val dependencies = startDependencyInjection(this) {
    setupStructuralModules()
    setupFeatureModules()
}
```

The context overload is an Android bootstrap function in `impl`. It registers only
the application Context and Application, never an Activity. SDK initialization
remains explicit in the Application and is separate from binding registration.

Plain JVM consumers can call `startDependencyInjection { ... }` without an Android
Context. `stopDependencyInjection()` closes the backend and releases its retained
instances. Starting twice fails; a failed configuration closes the partial container.
A later start creates a new graph.

## Registrations

```kotlin
val loginModule = dependencyModule {
    singleton<LoginRepository> {
        LoginRepositoryImpl(loginRemoteDataSource = get(), analytics = get())
    }
    factory<LoginService> { retrofitNoAuth.createService() }
}

loadModules(
    loginModule
)
```

`singleton` retains one instance per type and qualifier. `factory` creates one for
each resolution. Definitions use explicit constructor lambdas; no annotations,
reflection-based constructor wiring, or DI code generation is required. Later
registrations override earlier ones, including for existing test replacements.
Definitions are lazy and must not initialize SDKs or launch background work.

## Qualifiers and parameters

Qualifier objects implement `DependencyQualifier` and expose a stable String value.
Bindings are addressed by their type and qualifier value, so different types and
qualified/unqualified registrations remain independent. Generic type arguments are
erased: use distinct contracts or qualifiers when registering multiple parameterizations
of the same generic class.

```kotlin
val permissionsModule = dependencyModule {
    factory<PermissionsProvider> { parameters ->
        createPermissionsProvider(activity = parameters.get<ComponentActivity>())
    }
}

val provider = get<PermissionsProvider> { parametersOf(activity) }
```

`DependencyParameters` copies arguments into a per-resolution list. Typed access
selects the first assignable argument, including boxed primitive values. Missing
parameters fail explicitly. Singleton parameters apply only at first construction;
Activity-bound providers must remain factories.

`DependencyResolver` is the receiver for construction lambdas and shared helpers,
such as dispatcher and Retrofit accessors. It exposes no vendor Scope. Top-level
`get` and `inject` support framework-created components; prefer constructor
injection in business code. Lazy injection resolves only at first access.

## ViewModels

Register ViewModel construction with `factory { ... }` and explicit dependencies.
`di/api` exposes `DependencyViewModelProvider` and thin Activity/Fragment delegation
helpers. `di/impl` implements that contract using AndroidX `ViewModelProvider`,
preserving the owner's store and configuration-change retention. The design-system
only consumes the API; it does not implement DI or ViewModel construction.
The implementation uses AndroidX `viewModelFactory` with a per-type initializer
instead of a custom Factory class. It passes the owner's CreationExtras-derived
`SavedStateHandle` as a runtime
parameter. A ViewModel constructor can receive it through `parameters.get()` or
`get<SavedStateHandle>()` within its definition.

Resolving a ViewModel directly with `get()` bypasses lifecycle retention. Use the
API screen adapter for UI ViewModels. The core registration contracts expose no
Android or Koin types. The separate Android lifecycle bridge contract in the same
API explicitly uses AndroidX owner and ViewModel types; it exposes no backend types.

## Backend boundary

`DependencyContainer` resolves instances, loads `DependencyModule` declarations,
and closes the graph. `DependencyRegistry` registers factories. `di/impl` translates
these operations into Koin bindings using internal type-qualified keys. Koin types,
scopes, qualifiers, and parameter holders remain entirely inside the adapter.

The module intentionally does not introduce custom graph resolution, nested scopes,
auto-discovery, eager SDK startup, or compile-time processing. Consumers retain
constructor injection and use only the capabilities implemented by this contract.
