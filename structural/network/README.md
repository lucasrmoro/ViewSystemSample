# Network

Provides HTTP communication and connectivity contracts. Feature code depends only on
`network/api`; Retrofit, OkHttp, and Gson are implementation details of `network/impl`.
The API does not depend on `core`.

## Modules and DI

- `api`: `HttpClient`, request and response type models, JSON field names, exceptions,
  connectivity, and client qualifiers.
- `impl`: HTTP transport, JSON conversion, timeouts, logging, authentication, and connectivity.
- `di`: registrations using the project's DI contracts and composition of internal HTTP adapters.

The app calls `NetworkModule.init()` explicitly in `AppApplication`. The default
base URL comes from the network environment configuration through the DI registration of
`HttpClientConfiguration`. Override that binding before resolving clients when another
environment is required; `NetworkModule.init()` takes no arguments.
Load `CoreModule.init()` for dispatchers
and the login, session, and local-storage DI modules before resolving authenticated requests.
Registration does not perform requests or initialize background work. DI creates and registers
the authenticator and authorization interceptor, then passes them into `HttpClientFactory`.
These adapter contracts are used only by network composition; features resolve `HttpClient`.

Each qualifier has one shared client:

- `AuthenticatedHttpClient`: adds the stored access token and installs the token-refresh
  authenticator, which consumes `LoginRepository` from `login/domain/api`.
- `UnauthenticatedHttpClient`: has neither the authorization interceptor nor the authenticator.
  The login token-refresh service must use this client to avoid recursive authentication.

Feature DI can use `DependencyResolver.httpClient` and `httpClientNoAuth`, or resolve
`HttpClient` directly with a qualifier. It registers its own typed service implementations:

```kotlin
singleton<FeatureAService> { FeatureAServiceImpl(httpClient = httpClient) }
```

## Requests and typed responses

```kotlin
import br.com.viewsystem_sample.structural.network.http.HttpClient
import br.com.viewsystem_sample.structural.network.http.HttpRequest
import br.com.viewsystem_sample.structural.network.http.get
import br.com.viewsystem_sample.structural.network.http.post

val items = client.get<List<SomeDTO>>(
    HttpRequest(
        path = "items/{id}",
        pathParameters = mapOf("id" to id),
        query = mapOf("page" to "1"),
        headers = mapOf("Accept-Language" to "en")
    )
)

val created = client.post<SomeDTO>(HttpRequest("items"), body = payload)
val ignored = client.delete<Unit>(HttpRequest("items/{id}", mapOf("id" to id)))
```

`get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` have reified extensions that preserve collection and
nested generic types through the library-independent `HttpResponseType<T>`. The interface
accepts this type explicitly so implementations do not need inline methods.

Paths are relative to the configured base URL. Pass raw path and query values separately;
path substitutions are encoded as individual segments. Absolute URLs, unresolved placeholders,
and dot segments in path parameter values are rejected. Query and header maps support one
value per name. Requests and responses use JSON; request bodies are DTOs or native JSON-compatible
values. A null POST, PUT, or DELETE body is encoded as JSON null. Multipart uploads, streaming,
and binary response handling are outside this contract.

Use `Unit` for endpoints without a response body, including HTTP 204. Other response types
require a non-null JSON payload. `JsonName` maps DTO fields independently of the serialization SDK:

```kotlin
import br.com.viewsystem_sample.structural.network.http.JsonName

data class LoginDTO(
    @JsonName("AccessToken") val accessToken: String?,
    @JsonName("RefreshToken") val refreshToken: String?
)
```

Annotate every serialized request/response DTO field, including nested DTOs, with `JsonName`,
including names identical to the property,
to preserve mappings in minified builds. Missing or blank annotations cause
`HttpSerializationException`; the implementation never falls back to Kotlin field names.
Consumer rules retain these fields and captured
response types. Optional JVM TLS provider references from OkHttp are handled by
implementation consumer rules; they do not add providers to the Android app.
Request serialization runs on the injected I/O dispatcher. JSON responses are decoded on
the transport's background callback thread through a Reader, without allocating an intermediate
response String. Successful response bodies use streaming conversion. The call remains linked
to cancellation until decoding finishes, and both success and error bodies are closed afterwards.
Retrofit still buffers non-success bodies internally. Debug BODY logging may also buffer bodies;
release builds do not include that interceptor.

## Failures

- Non-2xx responses throw the API's `HttpException`, with `statusCode` and a decoded
  `ApiException`. Empty or unrecognized server error payloads use an empty `ApiException`.
- Invalid JSON and missing bodies for non-Unit responses throw `HttpSerializationException`.
- Transport failures propagate as standard I/O exceptions; cancellation is not converted
  into an HTTP error.

The core Flow extensions consume these API errors without depending on Retrofit or Gson.
The implementation configures call/read timeouts of 30 seconds. HTTP logging is configured
only in `src/debug`, using a `debugImplementation` dependency. `src/release` provides a
no-op builder extension; the logging interceptor dependency is absent from release APKs.
